# Advanced student management and e-learning system
My portfolio website -> https://ezop.herokuapp.com

I build this student management and e-learning system using django and Bootstrap for the front-end. You can watch the video on YouTube to find out how the app works in real time https://youtu.be/ytP-k95F0ug

For the quiz part, I used this repo as a reference -> https://github.com/tomwalker/django_quiz
